  Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs
---

Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written
in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a
static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs
to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.
